# Run For Your Life - Mobile App
- A solo project I did in University of Pannonia for a Mobile Programming class.
- This is a simple running app built with Android Studio and Java.
- The app can be used to start a running session that tracks our pace and overall distance. The app uses the built-in step counter of the phone to do this. (**note**: the way the app tracks the run is really far from optimal, it is only a way to test the use of one of the sensors of the phone!)
- The completed runs are stored in a local SQLite database!

### Happy running! :)
